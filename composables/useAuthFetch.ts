 * Also carries the 401 retry-once backstop that used to live in plugins/axios.js:
 * on a 401 (stale token from clock skew, or a refresh that hasn't landed yet),
 * force a fresh ID token and retry the request exactly once before giving up and
 * logging out. Normal expiry is handled proactively by plugins/firebase.client.ts,
