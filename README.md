## 1 Apr 2020

- Fixed Server Middleware - Needs to be included in Nuxt config file

- Tweaked Bible Retrieval to text that I need [Need to remember to change token]

- Added date file plug in. Realized need to re-compile using webpack for some reason for it to kick in

- Worked on cards and theme displays for Vuetify and made it LIGHT

- Practiced passing props into components

# TODO 

- Do a generic date check and choose passages accordingly

- Set authentication in place so that users can journal in private and see past journal entries

- Format verse numbers to display nicer, superscript instead of brackets
